  <p>
    The tidystats Word add-in can be used to report statistics in a Microsoft
    Word document, using a file created with the tidystats R package.
  </p>

  <h2>Main features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A user-friendly point-and-click interface to insert statistics in
      APA-style
    </li>
    <li>Insert multiple statistics with a single click</li>
    <li>
      Customize which statistics to include when inserting multiple statistics
    </li>
    <li>Update reported statistics with new statistics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    The tidystats Word add-in is available in the Office Add-in store. You can
    find this store in your Word document by going to the Add-in section of the
    Insert tab. Simply search for 'tidystats' and you should find the add-in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once installed, a button saying 'Insert Statistics' will be added to the
    Insert tab of your Word document.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>
    Using the tidystats add-in is relatively straightforward. You open the
    tidystats add-in by clicking on the 'Insert Statistics' button found in the
    Insert pane of your Word document. After tidystats opens, click on 'Upload
    statistics' to select the file created with the tidystats R package. This
    will reveal a list of analyses. Click on the dropdown arrows to reveal the
    statistics of each analysis.
  </p>

  />

  <p>
    You can click on an individual statistic or on a list of statistics (by
    clicking on 'Statistics:') to insert statistics into your document, at the
    location of your cursor.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is possible to customize exactly which statistics will be reported when
    inserting multiple statistics. Click on the gear icon next to 'Statistics:'
    to reveal checkboxes next to each statistic. By default, all checkboxes are
    checked. Unchecking a checkbox will prevent that statistic from being
    inserted when inserting multiple statistics at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can update reported statistics by uploading a new file and clicking on
    the 'Update statistics' button. This will automatically update all reported
    statistics with the statistics from the new file. Note: This requires that
    the identifier of each analysis is kept the same.
