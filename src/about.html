  <p>
    I developed tidystats to solve two different problems in statistics
    reporting. The first problem is that of incorrect statistics reporting. Many
    scientific papers contain
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2">
      statistical inconsistencies
    </a>
    , likely due to typos and copy-paste mistakes. The second problem is that of
    incomplete statistics reporting. Researchers often only report the
    statistics in their papers, which means they need to carefully balance
    comprehensive reporting with writing a legible text. As a result, statistics
    are sometimes summarized or omitted in favor of producing a clearer paper.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are several possible solutions to these two problems. To give people
    access to all the statistics, one can share the data and scripts of their
    study so that others can run the analyses themselves and obtain the required
    statistics. However, this is not (yet) very common, it is often
    time-consuming to do, and sometimes it is not possible to share the data.
  </p>

  <p>
    A solution to reducing statistical reporting errors is to write scientific
    papers using reproducible software solutions like R Markdown. However, there
    are some downsides to using software like
    <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> or
    <a href="http://quarto.org">Quarto</a>. It is more difficult to collaborate
    with others and I often prefer to use software dedicated to writing papers,
    such as Microsoft Word.
  </p>

  <p>
    tidystats is my attempt at producing a user-friendly solution to the
    problems of incorrect and incomplete statistics reporting.
  </p>

  <p>tidystats works in two steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Save the output of statistical tests performed in
      <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Report statistics in
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word">
        Microsoft Word
      </a>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The tidystats R packageis used to create a machine-readable .JSON file that
    contains all the statistics contained within your analyses. This file can be
    read by other software, such as the tidystats Word add-in. This addresses
    the problem of incomplete statistics reporting because the file contains all
    the statistics.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tidystats Word add-in can read the file created by the R package so that
    you can insert the statistics in your document using a human-friendly
    interface. Simply click on the statistic(s) you want to insert and the
    statistic(s) will be inserted into your document. This addresses the problem
    of incorrect statistics because it does not require manually typing in the
    statistics.
  </p>
