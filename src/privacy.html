  <h1 class="text-center py-5">Privacy Statement</h1>

  <p>
    tidystats software, both the R package and the Word add-in, does not collect
    or transmit user information, and does not rely on external services except
    for hosting the necessary files.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tidystats Word add-in requires an internet connection, but this is only
    used to retrieve the files needed to perform its functions of parsing and
    inserting statistics into your Word document. All processing is done
    directly on your machine.
  </p>

  <p>
    tidystats software does not contain any user analytics. In other words, I do
    not track anything you do when using tidystats. If you like using tidystats,
    simply let me know via
    <a href="https://twitter.com/tidystats">Twitter</a> or send me an
    <a href="mailto:tidystats@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    RStudio does <a href="http://cran-logs.rstudio.com">track</a> how many times
    R packages are downloaded from CRAN and Microsoft does similar tracking.

    If you send a support e-mail, your e-mail address will only be used for
    tidystats support purposes.
