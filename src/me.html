  <p class="mt-3">
    I'm a Senior Behavioral Scientist at
    <a href="http://rethinkpriorities.org">Rethink Priorities</a>. Rethink
    Priorities is a research organization that conducts research to inform
    policymakers and major foundations about how to best help people and animals
    in both the present and the long-term future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before joining Rethink Prorities, I worked as an Assistant Professor in the
    Social Psychology department of
    <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/w-w-a-sleegers">
      Tilburg University
    </a>
    .
  </p>

  <p>
    I love all aspects of doing research, including figuring out ways how to do
    better research. That is why I developed tidystats.
