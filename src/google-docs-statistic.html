  <p>
    Each statistic inserted with the tidystats Google Docs add-in becomes a
    link. By turning each statistic into a link, we can identify all the
    statistics in the document and enable features such as automatic updating.
  </p>

  <p>
    It might look a bit weird that each statistic is a link, but this is
    unfortunately the only way for the add-in to have the important automatic
    updating functionality.
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert-danger">
    If you want a statistic to remain updatable, make sure to keep the links in
    tact.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are few instances where you would want to remove the links from each
    statistic. For example, when you convert the document to a PDF or other
    document, or share the Google Docs with others. In this case, we recommend
    that you make a copy of the document and use the 'Remove tidystats links'
    menu option to remove all the tidystats statistics links in the document
    (this feature will soon be added).
