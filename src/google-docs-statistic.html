  <p>
    Each statistic inserted with the tidystats Google Docs add-in becomes a
    link. By turning each statistic into a link, we can identify all the
    statistics on a page and automatically update them when you upload a new
    file and click on the 'Update statistics' button.
  </p>

  <p>
    It might look a bit weird that each Google Docs statistic is a link, but
    this is unfortunately the only way for the add-in to have the important
    automatic updating functionality.
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert-danger">
    If you want a Google Docs statistic to remain updatable, make sure to keep
    the links in tact.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you no longer wish for a Google Docs statistic to be updatable, you can
    freely remove the links. There are few instances where you would want to
    remove this feature, but unfortunately you might want to remove the links
    when you convert the document to a PDF or other document, or share the
    Google Docs with others. In this case, we recommend that you make a copy of
    the document and use the 'Remove tidystats links' menu option to remove all
    the tidystats-related links in the document (this feature will soon be
    added).
