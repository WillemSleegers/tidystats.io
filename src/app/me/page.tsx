        I'm a Senior Behavioral Scientist at{" "}
        <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org">Rethink Priorities</a>. Rethink
        Priorities is a research organization that conducts research to inform
        policymakers and major foundations about how to best help people and
        animals in both the present and the long-term future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before joining Rethink Prorities, I worked as an Assistant Professor in
        the Social Psychology department of{" "}
        <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu">Tilburg University</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love all aspects of doing research, including figuring out ways how to
        do better research. That is why I developed tidystats.
