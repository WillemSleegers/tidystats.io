        <p>
          I developed tidystats to solve two different problems in
          statistics reportingâ€”incorrect statistics and incomplete statistics
          reporting.
        </p>
        <h2>Incorrect statistics reporting</h2>
        <p>
          Many scientific papers contain{" "}
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2">
            statistical inconsistencies
          </a>
          . These inconsistencies are detected via software like{" "}
          <a href="https://michelenuijten.shinyapps.io/statcheck-web/">
            statcheck
          </a>
          . This software detects statistics and re-calculates certain
          statistics in a paper to see whether the reported statistics match the
          re-calculated statistics. This technique has revealed that often the
          statistics don't line up, meaning that the reported statistics are
          incorrect. This shouldn't be surprising because the most common method
          for inserting statistics is by simply manually typing them into a text
          editor or by copy-pasting results from the statistics software. In
          either case it is easy to make a mistake, causing these statistical
          inconsistencies.
        </p>
        <h2>Incomplete statistics reporting</h2>
        <p>
          Not all statistics are reported. Researchers often only report
          statistics in their papers, which means they need to carefully balance
          comprehensive reporting with writing a legible text. As a result,
          statistics are sometimes summarized or omitted in favor of producing a
          clearer paper. While this may seem like a reasonable compromise, the
          statistics are still necessary to check conclusions or for use in
          subsequent work (e.g., meta-analyses).
        </p>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          There are several possible solutions to these two problems. To give
          everyone access to the statistics, one can share the data and scripts
          of their study so that others can run the analyses themselves and
          obtain the required statistics. However, this is not (yet) very
          common, it is often time-consuming to do, and sometimes it is not
          possible to share the data.
        </p>

        <p>
          A solution to reducing statistical reporting errors is to write
          scientific papers using reproducible software solutions like{" "}
          <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> or{" "}
          <a href="http://quarto.org">Quarto</a>. However, there are some
          downsides to using this kind of software. It is often more difficult
          to collaborate with others because not everyone in the team knows how
          to work with this kind of software and the software is not as feature
          rich as more well-known text editors such as Microsoft Word or Google
          Docs.
        </p>

        <h2>tidystats</h2>
        <p>
          tidystats is my attempt at producing a user-friendly solution to the
          problems of incorrect and incomplete statistics reporting.
        </p>

        <p>tidystats works in two steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Save the output of statistical tests performed in{" "}
            <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Report statistics in{" "}
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word">
              Microsoft Word
            </a>{" "}
            (and soon in{" "}
            <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/">Google Docs</a>)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The tidystats R package is used to create a machine-readable .JSON
          file that contains all the statistics from your analyses. This file
          can be read by other software, such as the tidystats Word add-in. This
          addresses the problem of incomplete statistics reporting because the
          file contains all the statistics. You can report the statistics easily
          using this file, or share the file itself so all statistics are
          shared.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tidystats Word add-in can read the file created by the R package
          so that you can insert the statistics in your document using a
          human-friendly interface. Simply click on the statistic(s) you want to
          insert and the statistic(s) will be inserted into your document. This
          addresses the problem of incorrect statistics because it does not
          require manually typing in the statistics.
        </p>
